## 👋🏽 Hey 
I'm Miguel, a freelance web designer from Michigan, USA!

## 🤔 About 
I grew up enjoying video games, building things with Lego pieces, and tinkering with computers and other technologies. Eventually, I learned basic HTML and CSS in high school. I graduated with an Associate in Web Design and earned my Responsive Web Design certificate from freeCodeCamp. I create clean and professional websites and iconic logos for individuals, small and medium-sized businesses.
